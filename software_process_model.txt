The agile process model is best suited for the development of our expense sharing app. 
Agile methodologies, such as Scrum, offer the flexibility for us to create new requirements/functionalities and make changes to the application per user feedback. 
Any development ideas can be addressed in a scrum meeting, and the development team would focus and work on each topic on a daily basis. 
In the first scrum meeting, the team will come together with the customers and lay out the basic requirements and functionalities for the app (can be seen in project_scope and functional/non-functional requirements specified in other sections of this deliverable) and begin the development process. 
For every meeting afterwards, the team will attempt to implement each functionality and requirement and have the customers review them. 
Each feature should be kept simple and adaptable for the development process to take after the agile process model. 
The increment phase and development process will end when customers are mostly satisfied with the final product (every requested feature is implemented with little to no issues).
